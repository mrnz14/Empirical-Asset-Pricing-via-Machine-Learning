# Empirical-Asset-Pricing-via-Machine-Learning

This project applies machine learning to predict stock returns and build an AI-driven portfolio. Using price and volume data, it involves descriptive statistics, OLS and Ridge regression models, and advanced methods like neural networks or decision trees to forecast returns. Performance metrics include out-of-sample R-squared, sign accuracy, and MSE. All methods are tested and compared, to better understand the most effective ones for asset pricing. The script provides all the necessary code, along with step-by-step explanations of the results.
